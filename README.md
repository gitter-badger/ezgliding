Release notes for the ezgliding.com software. See below for information
on how to use and contribute.

WHAT IS EZGLIDING.COM?

  It is both a website and a set of software applications to help with 
  analysing, visualizing and planning gliding flights.

  The website uses the software applications behind, offering an easy
  to use interface to the functionality.

REQUIREMENTS:

  ezgliding.com only requires a modern browser (we suggest Chrome).

  Using the software applications directly requires a recent version
  of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

CONTRIBUTING:

  You can contribute in terms of development or data (airspace, waypoints, ..).
  
  Check https://github.com/rochaporto/ezgliding/wiki/Contributing for details.
