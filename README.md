## What

It is both a website and a set of software applications to help with  
analysing, visualizing and planning gliding flights.

The website uses the software applications behind, offering an easy  
to use interface to the functionality.

## How

ezgliding.com only requires a modern browser (we suggest Chrome).

Using the software applications directly requires a recent version  
of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
