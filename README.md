# ezgliding [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rochaporto/ezgliding.svg?branch=ezgo)](http://travis-ci.org/rochaporto/ezgliding)  [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/rochaporto/ezgliding?status.png)](https://godoc.org/github.com/rochaporto/ezgliding) ![Project Status](http://img.shields.io/badge/status-prealpha-red.svg) 

## What

It is both a website and a set of software applications to help with  
analysing, visualizing and planning gliding flights.

The website uses the software applications behind, offering an easy  
to use interface to the functionality.

## How

ezgliding.com only requires a modern browser (we suggest Chrome).

Using the software applications directly requires a recent version  
of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

## Contributing

  You can contribute in terms of development or data (airspace, waypoints, ..).
